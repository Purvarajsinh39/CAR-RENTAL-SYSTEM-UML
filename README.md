# 🚗 Car Rental System UML Project - 4th Semester

## 📚 About the Project

This project presents the **UML diagrams** for a **Car Rental System**, created as part of the 4th semester coursework.  
The system models the process of renting vehicles, managing users, and handling bookings through well-structured UML diagrams.

The diagrams were developed using **draw.io** (`.drawio` format) for easy viewing, editing, and exporting.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
