# 🚗 Car Rental System UML Project - 4th Semester

## 📚 About the Project

This project presents the **UML diagrams** for a **Car Rental System**, created as part of the 4th semester coursework.  
The system models the process of renting vehicles, managing users, and handling bookings through well-structured UML diagrams.

The diagrams were developed using **draw.io** (`.drawio` format) for easy viewing, editing, and exporting.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [**draw.io**](https://app.diagrams.net/) — for creating and editing UML diagrams.

## 📋 Project Structure

The project contains the following UML diagrams:

| Diagram Type         | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Use Case Diagram** | Shows how customers and admins interact with the car rental system. |
| **Class Diagram**    | Defines the system's main classes like Car, Customer, Booking, Payment, etc. |
| **Activity Diagram** | Represents the workflow of renting a car from browsing to booking. |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Displays the interaction between a customer, system, and admin during booking. |
| **ER Diagram** *(optional)* | Describes the database tables and relationships if database design is included. |
